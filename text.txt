public class FileReader
extends InputStreamReader
Convenience class for reading character files. The constructors of this class assume that the default
character encoding and the default byte-buffer size are appropriate. To specify these values yourself,
construct an InputStreamReader on a FileInputStream.
FileReader is meant for reading streams of characters. For reading streams of raw bytes, consider using a FileInputStream.
